Description: This package gives an easy-to-use interface for the Pushbullet
 service at which provides fast and efficient  notifications between
 computers, phones and tablets.  An account has to be registered at the 
 http://www.pushbullet.com site in order to obtain a (free) id.
 .
 The package currently uses the curl binary directly as using the RCurl 
 package worked only partially: messages can be sent, but return codes from
 the service are lost.  
Imports: utils, RJSONIO
SystemRequirements: The 'curl' binary somewhere in the path, a user key
 which can be obtained from http://www.pushbullet.com, and one or more
 devices to push messages too which may be any one of an Android phone, 
 iPhone, or the Chrome browser provided the corresponding Pushbullet 'app'
 has been installed.
